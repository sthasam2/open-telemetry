# OpenTelemetry Collector

This repository contains very simple open telemetry setup. It was copied from [`open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/examples/demo).

We modified it for you so it can be use for developing your Next.js application without any changes. Just run the following command in your command line to run all services provided here:
